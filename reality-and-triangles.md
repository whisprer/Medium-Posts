# What Links the Possible Structure of Reality and Triangles?

## Wacław Sierpiński, a Polish mathematician.

### Born March 14, 1882, in Warsaw, which was, at the time, part of the Russian Empire.

Nope, i'm not starting a highschool essay.

Honest - he really does.

He was a guy with an absolute brilliant mind who made significant contributions to set theory, number theory, and topology, but he’s most famous for his work in fractal geometry — those wild, self-repeating shapes that look cool and bend your brain a little.

The Sierpiński Triangle, also called the Sierpiński Gasket, is his claim to fame.

It’s a fractal that starts with a single equilateral triangle, and then you keep removing smaller triangles from it in a specific pattern forever (or until you get bored, I suppose). He first cooked up this idea around 1915, and it’s a classic example of a self-similar structure (meaning it looks the same no matter how much you zoom in.) Pretty trippy, right?

Sierpiński wasn’t just a one-trick pony, though. He studied math at the University of Warsaw, got his doctorate in 1908, and went on to teach and research across Europe, even during some rough times like World War I. He was a big deal in the Polish math scene and helped build up the country’s academic community. Despite living through wars and political upheaval, he kept churning out ideas — over 700 papers and 50 books, to be exact. The dude was unstoppable.

He passed away on October 21, 1969, in Warsaw, but his legacy lives on every time someone doodles a Sierpiński Triangle or stares at a fractal screensaver.

So?

Let’s follow along in the guy's footsteps and have some fun — after all, he was a math rockstar who gave us a shape that’s equal parts simple and mind-boggling - it's gotta be fun, right?

let’s get you started by drawing a Sierpiński Triangle! It’s super fun and not _too_ tricky once you get the hang of it -  Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to sketch one by hand;

## How to Draw a Sierpiński Triangle:
- *Start with a Big Triangle:* Grab a piece of paper and draw a large equilateral triangle. Doesn’t have to be perfect — just make the sides roughly equal. This is your base shape, or "Level 0."
- *Find the Midpoints:* On each side of the triangle, mark the halfway point. You can eyeball it or use a ruler if you’re feeling precise.
- *Connect the Dots:* Draw lines connecting these midpoints to form a smaller upside-down triangle in the center. You’ll see that this splits the big triangle into three smaller triangles around the edges, with the middle one being “cut out” (just imagine it’s gone for now).
- *Repeat in the Smaller Triangles:* Take each of the three remaining triangles (the ones that aren’t “cut out”) and do the same thing—find the midpoints of their sides, connect them, and “remove” the middle triangle. Now you’ve got even smaller triangles.
- *Keep Going (Optional):* You can repeat this process as many times as you want. Each time, you’ll get more tiny triangles, and the pattern starts looking more fractal-like. Three or four rounds usually give you a nice Sierpiński vibe without needing a magnifying glass!
*_Quick Tips_*
- _Use a pencil first so you can erase if needed._
- _If you color it, shade the “removed” triangles (or leave them blank) to see the pattern pop._
- _Don’t stress about perfection—fractals are about the vibe, not exactness._

Ok, that wasn't too bad.
Now, let's do this via mathematical logic;
In logic, a Sierpiński triangle can be drawn by coloring the first 16 conjunctions of lexicographically ordered arguments on a grid where the columns are interpreted as binary numbers i.e. giving us *1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51...* (_this is sequence A001317 in the OEIS for any other OEIS fans - yes i'm a touch on the spectrum_) - although, the actual fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of iterations.

Specifically, this Logic can be stated as, more formally, describing it in terms of functions on closed sets of points:
"let dA denote the dilation by a factor of ⁠1/2⁠ about a point A, then the Sierpiński triangle with corners A, B, and C is the fixed set of the transformation dA ∪ dB ∪ dC⁠."
This is an 'attractive fixed' set, so that when the operation is applied to any other set repeatedly, the images converge on the Sierpiński triangle. (in fact,although this _is_ what is happening with the triangle above, any other set would suffice too.)

Employing number;
For integer number of dimensions d, when doubling a side of an object, 2^d copies of it are created, i.e. 2 copies for 1-dimensional object, 4 copies for 2-dimensional object and 8 copies for 3-dimensional object, 16 copies for a 4-dimensional object and so-on. For the Sierpiński triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of itself. 
This brings us to be able to say the Sierpiński triangle has *'Hausdorff dimension'* log3/log2 ≈ 1.585, which follows from solving 2^d = 3 for d. why do i mention this? we'll come back to this later...

The area of a Sierpiński triangle is zero (in Lebesgue measure).
This means The area remaining after each iteration is 3/4 of the area from the previous iteration, and an infinite number of iterations results in an area approaching zero. (also relevant later)

This technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes, for instance, subdividing a square  removing the middle  and recursing leads to the 'Sierpiński carpet'. In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge.


## Could the fabric of reality be a fractal?

What if the universe isn’t smooth and continuous, but instead resembles a Menger sponge — a 3D fractal full of endlessly nested cavities and intricate self-similarity?
 
One speculative hypothesis proposes that our universe’s structure might resemble a Menger sponge - first described by Karl Menger in 1926, a 3D fractal with endless cavities and intricate self-similarity; it also explores what that means for the idea that we live in a simulation. This idea blends cosmology, mathematics, quantum gravity, and simulation theory into one speculative but intriguing model of reality.


## The Historical Roots of the Fractal Universe

### Early Thinkers:
Charlier (1908), Fournier d'Albe, and Lambert imagined hierarchical, “worlds within worlds” universes to explain cosmic observations like Olbers’ paradox. These ideas predated formal fractal math but hinted at scale invariance.

### The Fractal Revolution:
Benoît Mandelbrot’s Fractal Geometry of Nature (1982) introduced fractals as a model for natural structures. Pietronero (1987) observed galaxy clustering patterns that fit a fractal dimension of ~2, suggesting large-scale self-similarity.

### The Menger Sponge Re-enters the Chat:
The sponge (Karl Menger, 1926) provided a vivid metaphor: infinitely porous, zero volume, and infinite surface area (there's our infinite surface area returning from earlier). Later thinkers like Sylos Labini and even Zel’dovich explored sponge-like or foam-like cosmic structures.


## Mathematical Implications of a Menger Sponge Reality

### Key Features:
- Hausdorff dimension (remember from even earlier?) ≈ 2.7268 (between 2D and 3D)
- Infinite surface area but zero volume
- Self-similarity at all scales

### Physics Consequences:
- Reality would be mostly holes—evocative of atomic-scale emptiness and cosmic voids.
- El Naschie proposed a fractal dimension explains why only ~4.5% of the universe’s energy is visible (the rest is “missing” as dark matter/energy).
- A space with fractional dimension might radically alter physical laws like gravity or field interactions.


## Fractal Structures in Theoretical Physics

### Cosmology:
- Generally, galaxy distribution in the universe appears fractal up to ~100–300 Mpc., beyond that, the universe seems statistically homogeneous, but still the cosmic web (voids + filaments) is reminiscent of fractal or sponge-like architecture.

### At A Quantum Scale:
- Quantum gravity theories (like Causal Dynamical Triangulations, Loop Quantum Gravity - you know, the easy stuff...) suggest that spacetime becomes fractal at Planck-scale - effective dimensionality reduces from 4 to ~2 as we zoom in, this is called “dimensional reduction.” Nottale’s Scale Relativity and El Naschie’s E-infinity both treat space-time and particle paths as inherently fractal.


## Fractals and Higher Dimensions
Karl Svozil suggests our universe could be a fractal subset embedded in a higher-dimensional space—a Menger sponge “floating” in an unseen super-verse - this bridges to string theory or brane-world scenarios but with fractional rather than integer dimensions. In this view, the world appears 3D, but reality may be a lower-dimensional “shadow” or projection—an eerie geometric parallel to Plato’s cave.


## Fractal Reality & Simulation Theory

### Does It Support Simulation Theory?
Fractals can be generated by simple rules—potentially evidence of an underlying “program” or intelligent design.
Some see fractal structure as a sign of algorithmic compression in a simulated world.

### Does It Challenge Simulation Theory?
True fractals have infinite depth. Simulations with finite computing power couldn’t represent this literally.
If our reality does have infinite nested detail (no “resolution limit”), that may argue against a digital simulation—unless it uses something more exotic like continuous math or analog computing.

### Nested Simulations as a Fractal Stack:
Simulations within simulations could form a “fractal tower” of realities. Philosophically, this invites reflection on infinite regress and whether a “base reality” is even meaningful.


## Experimental and Theoretical Hurdles
No conclusive experimental evidence supports a fully fractal reality—so far. Cosmological surveys show some fractal behavior, but also large-scale homogenization. Theoretical work in mathematical physics (e.g., field theory on fractals) suggests that if space were fractal, things like wave propagation or gravity might behave oddly—but no anomalies have yet been observed.

### Escaping The Simulation
What does fractal reality mean for a possible 'Escape Hatch' from simulation? Could fractal structure offer an escape route from a simulated universe? 
...Maybe!

- Infinite detail might stress the simulation engine, leaving detectable “rendering” artifacts—like computational noise or inconsistency at deep zooms. Anomalies in physics at fine scales (e.g., gravity behaving oddly at ~10⁻²⁰ m) could hint at fractal structure or simulation limits. Nested fractal layers might be like “simulation levels.” Zooming in or out could correspond to traversing realities—but we’d need a way to manipulate this scaling to “break out.”

- Fractional dimensionality could be leveraged (in a sci-fi sense) to “hack” the simulation—if our control over local dimensions becomes possible via exotic tech or quantum tuning. Fractal consciousness theories speculate that awareness itself might mirror reality’s self-similar structure—potentially offering intuitive pathways to perceive or transcend simulation boundaries.

# Final Thoughts
The Menger sponge metaphor unites speculative cosmology, quantum gravity, fractal mathematics, and deep philosophical questions. Whether it’s a literal description of the universe or a poetic approximation, it prompts us to think of space not as an empty backdrop, but as an intricate, living structure.

If the universe is a Menger sponge… then perhaps:
- Matter is a fragile thread,
- Void is the default,
- Reality is recursive,
- And “breaking out” is not about moving through space, but between levels of structure or understanding.

I must admit, when i read Haussdorf dimension ≈ 2.7268, not 2 or 3 or i kinda drifted off down an 'oh - well we're in a 3D space + 1D time = 4D universe, right? guess this whole theory is wrong' tack.

Unfortunately it seems likely it'll take more then even some hefty quantum computing power before we're gonna know...
