# Is "Vibe Coding" 'Cheating' or The Future of The Programming Workplace?

_(insert main image here)_

## _An Opinionated View, How To and Review._


### n.b. This is *_not_* an anti-vibe coding rant.

It is however a fantastic demo of the drawbacks and limitations of LLMs that make vibe coding of limited use in many situations without some degree of prior coding and/or subject specific knowledge:


### Lets use the example of trying to debug some existing code; We begin by attaching the code we need help with and the initial prompt:

"fren, here's a [Language] script intended for [XXXXXXX]. it is supposed to work by [xxxxxxxx]. please can you debug, identifying and correcting any syntactical or logical errors in the code? also any efforts you can make to optimize with respect to overall code length and elegance would be appreciated too, as long a absolutely _no_ functionality is lost whatsoever! can you please give output as a full code artifact, no snippets or placeholders used anywhere, at all. thnx fren!"

[LLM Response...]


"and how do I use the script you provided fren? could you give clear, simple step-by-step instructions please?"

[LLM Response‚Ä¶]


### if success; 


"are then any other optimizations we could perform upon the code fren?"

[LLM Response]


### Or, if you encounter an error, paste it in to the LLM and let 'im tell you ho to fix it:


"hmm... i seem to have com across a lil' glitch fren?
`bash`
`PS C:\Users\user\path\to\code\repo > python code.py`
`Traceback (most recent call last):`
`  File "C:\Users\user\path\to\code\repo\code.py", line 1, in <module>`
`    thingy = int(thingy(thingy))`
`                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^`
`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\x00\x00\x002'`
can you help me solve it please?"


[follow instructions]

...

[iterate as necessary]


### or if output\code failure, then paste in the output:


"fren, we got a fail:
`bash`
`[PS C:\Users\user\path\to\code\repo > python code.py`
`...output...]`
output should have been "Hello World" but instead we got "fail"...
what could possibly have happened - any clues?"

[follow instructions]

...

[iterate as necessary]



## Easy, Huh? So, let's see an example of it in action...



### Initial prompt/response exchange:
### It begins just fine;


`[attachment] encrypt.py`
`Python`
fren, here's a Python script intended for plain text encryption. it is supposed to work by converting the plaintext  to encrypted hex-code via a key (also hex-code output) - it needs the hex-code char count to decrypt too!  this one rotates the hex message a given amount before XOR;  it then XORs the hexes of direction and amount to make random hex for transmit. please can you debug, identifying and correcting any syntactical or logical errors in the code? also any efforts you can make to optimize with respect to overall code length and elegance would be appreciated too, as long a absolutely _no_ functionality is lost whatsoever! can you please give output as a full code artifact, no snippets or placeholders used anywhere, at all. thnx fren!


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, fren! I've debugged and optimized your script for both syntax correctness and logical clarity, preserving all functionality precisely. Here's the complete, cleaned-up, and optimized Python script as requested:

Hex Encrypt Debugged

_(insert image here)_

Changes made and reasons:
Removed Redundant Functions:
Simplified by using just one clear function (count_chars) for counting characters.

Optimized Bitwise Rotation:
Ensured rotations correctly wrap bits by using modulo bit-length.

Simplified XOR Logic:
Created a reusable xor_hex function for clarity and conciseness.

Handled Edge Cases:
Ensured rotation does not exceed bit-length, preventing logic errors.

Improved Code Clarity and Readability:
Made function names and variables descriptive and consistent.

This preserves all the functionality you initially had, maintaining precision while improving readability and efficiency, fren!



### And we continue:


You said:
how do i use this one fren?


ChatGPT said:
Good question, fren! Let's walk through exactly how you use this optimized script, step by step, with clear explanations:

üü¢ Step 1: Set Up Your Inputs
Look inside the script, specifically in this section:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`# Example inputs`
`txt_msg = "Hell World"`
`txt_key = "Secretses"`
`shift_amt = 2`
`direction = 'left'`


Here's what each input means:

- txt_msg: The plaintext message you want to encrypt.

- txt_key: A secret key used for XOR encryption. Keep this safe!

- shift_amt: How many bits you rotate your message by. Can be any positive integer.

- direction: Rotation direction, either 'left' or 'right'.

Simply replace these example values with your own.

üü¢ Step 2: Run the Script
Save the script as, say, encrypt.py, then execute it from your terminal or command prompt:

`bash [Copy/Edit]`
`python encrypt.py`

üü¢ Step 3: Reading the Output
When executed, the script provides detailed output like this:

`pgsql [Copy/Edit]`
`Message text: Hell World`
`Original message (hex): 48656C6C20576F726C64`
`Rotated message (hex): 1959B1B0815DBDC9B190`
`Encrypted message (hex): 1C06111D4550191F1E17`
`Key text: Secretses, Key hex: 536563726574736573`
`Character count: 10, Count (hex): 3130`
`Rotation direction: left, Direction (hex): 6C656674`
`Rotation amount: 2, Amount (hex): 32`
`Random hex from direction & amount XOR: 6C656646`
`Random hex char count (hex): 38`

Here's what each line means in detail:

- Message text: Your original plaintext message.
- Original message (hex): Hexadecimal representation of your plaintext.
- Rotated message (hex): The hex message after rotation by your specified bits.
- Encrypted message (hex): The result of XOR between your plaintext hex and key hex (your actual encrypted output!).
- Key text & Key hex: Your encryption key in plaintext and hex.
- Character count: Number of characters in your plaintext, also shown as hex.
- Rotation direction & amount: Your specified rotation direction and bits, shown clearly in hex form.
- Random hex from direction & amount XOR: XOR combination of rotation direction and amount, creating randomness for transmission.
- Random hex char count: Character count of the random hex, represented in hex.


üü¢ Step 4: How to Decrypt?
To decrypt your message, the receiver must know:

- The encrypted hex message (Encrypted message (hex))
- Your secret key (Key hex)
- Rotation direction and amount
- Decryption steps (for future reference):
- XOR the encrypted hex message again with the key hex to retrieve the rotated hex.
- Perform the opposite rotation (if encrypted with 'left', decrypt with 'right', and vice versa).
- Convert the resulting hex back into plaintext.

That's everything, fren! You've now got a complete encryption script ready to go. Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need a matching decrypt script to go with it! üåü


### Continuing, we seem to be cruising; 

You said:
`[attachment] decrypt.py`
`Python`
here's the decrypt program i had based on my previous code - cold you please adjust it to work with your new script, debugging to deal with syntax and logic errors on the way. again, optimizations for code length and elegance are welcomed as long as absolutely no functionality is lost whatsoever. could you please provide output as a full code artifact with no snippets or placeholders at all. thnx fren!


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely fren! Here's your optimized, debugged, and fully functional decryption script perfectly aligned to your new encryption logic, ready as a complete artifact without placeholders or snippets:

Hex Decrypt Debugged
üîë How this version is improved & debugged:
Matched precisely with the encryption logic I previously provided.

Optimized XOR and rotation logic to exactly mirror encryption, ensuring full reversibility.

Included clear variable names and structured logic flow for readability and elegance.

Handled hexadecimal padding to prevent truncation or misalignment of decrypted values.

Removed unnecessary or redundant functions for brevity and clarity.

Provided detailed output statements for easy debugging and validation of every step.

You can simply plug in your encrypted hex message and parameters (key, random hex, direction hex, and character count) and this script will fully and accurately decrypt the message.

If you have more questions or would like anything else adjusted, just let me know, fren! üåü



### So bringing us to our first hurdle - an error on output. The code he said would run; doesn't.
### But that's ok, we're vibin', we'll just give him the error and he'll solve it, ...right?


You said:
hmm... i seem to have com across a lil' glitch fren?
`bash`
`PS C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\coding\crypt_keeper\g-petey_4-5_has_a_go> python decrypt.py`

`PS C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\coding\crypt_keeper\g-petey_4-5_has_a_go>`
can you help me solve it please?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, fren! Let's break down what happened and fix this clearly and quickly.

üêû What caused the glitch?
The line causing the error is:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`shift_amt = int(hex_to_txt(shift_amt_hex))`

This error occurs because the hex_to_txt() function attempts to decode a hex string (shift_amt_hex) that is not a valid plaintext UTF-8 representation. The hex string represents binary data (XOR result), which might contain non-printable characters or leading zeros ('\x00'), causing decoding to plaintext and then integer conversion to fail.

üöÄ How to fix it properly:
We need to interpret shift_amt_hex directly as a hexadecimal integer rather than converting it to plaintext first.

Replace this problematic line:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`shift_amt = int(hex_to_txt(shift_amt_hex))`

With this corrected version:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`shift_amt = int(shift_amt_hex, 16)`

Here, we directly interpret shift_amt_hex as a hex integer‚Äîbypassing unnecessary and potentially invalid UTF-8 conversions entirely.

‚úÖ Corrected Section (fully integrated fix):
Here‚Äôs how the relevant block of the corrected decryption code should look:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`# XOR random hex and direction hex to retrieve shift amount`
`shift_amt_hex = xor_hex(random_hex, direction_hex)`

`# FIXED: Directly interpret shift amount hex as integer`
`shift_amt = int(shift_amt_hex, 16)`

`# Determine rotation direction from hex`
`direction = hex_to_txt(direction_hex).lower()`

üõ† Why this fix works perfectly:
The shift amount was initially encoded as plaintext integer hex during encryption ("2" becomes "32" hex), but after XOR-ing two hex values, the result isn't necessarily a valid plaintext character anymore.

By converting directly from hex-to-integer, we safely bypass any decoding issues caused by non-UTF-8 values.

üí° Additional Recommendation:
For robustness, ensure your original encryption script encodes the shift_amt consistently as a numeric hex (e.g., "2" ‚Üí "32" hex) without added padding or extra characters.

üìå Quick fix recap:
Replace this line:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`shift_amt = int(hex_to_txt(shift_amt_hex))`

With:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`shift_amt = int(shift_amt_hex, 16)`

This fixes the glitch entirely.

Try this change, fren‚Äîyour script should run beautifully afterward! Let me know if you run into anything else! üåü



### Well, that was a thorough, step by step well explained answer, with clear examples ready to be copypasta'd right into place, not bad eh?
### It turns out - no.


You said:
fren, we got a fail:

`bash`
`PS C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\coding\crypt_keeper\g-petey_4-5_has_a_go> python decrypt.py`
`Encrypted message (hex): 1C06111D4550191F1E17`

`Decrypted message (plaintext): kc']`
`Original message character count: 10`
`PS C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\coding\crypt_keeper\g-petey_4-5_has_a_go>`
output should have been "Hello World" but instead we got "`kc']`"...
what could possibly have happened - any clues?


ChatGPT said:
Ah, good catch, fren! Let's slow down and identify exactly what's happening here, because this issue is subtle but very important.

üß© Why did the decryption fail?
We see your output:

`vbnet [Copy/Edit]`
`Decrypted message (plaintext): kc']`

instead of the expected:

`nginx [Copy/Edit]`
`Hello World`

üîç Detailed analysis:
The clue is in the calculated shift amount:

`java [Copy/Edit]`
`Calculated shift amount (hex): 00000032, Shift amount (int): 50`


This is the critical problem!

Your intended `shift_amt` in the encryption was `2`, and indeed, `ASCII "2"` is `hex 32`. However, after `XOR`-ing with direction hex (`"left"`), the result becomes a large hex value (`00000032`) which, interpreted as an integer (`0x32`), becomes `50` decimal instead of `2`.

Thus, your decrypting script is mistakenly shifting by 50 bits instead of 2 bits, severely corrupting your decrypted output.

üö® What caused this confusion?
The issue comes down to how rotation amount (`shift_amt`) is encoded and `XOR`'d during encryption:

In the encryption script, you currently encode the integer `shift_amt` as a `plaintext` character ("`2`"), hex-encode it ("`32`"), then `XOR` it directly with direction ("`left`") hex ("`6C656674`"), which is multi-byte text.

This `XOR` result does NOT decode cleanly back into a simple integer because it‚Äôs influenced by the length mismatch and character encoding.

üõ† How to properly fix this issue (best solution):
We need to handle `XOR`-ing direction and shift amounts numerically, NOT via textual hex. Let's clearly and robustly implement this fix in both scripts:

‚úÖ Encryption fix:
In your encryption script, encode direction as a simple integer (`0` for left, `1` for right), `XOR` this integer with shift amount integer numerically, ensuring the XOR result is directly reversible.

Adjusted Encryption Example:

Replace this logic in your encryption script:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`direction_flag = 0 if direction == 'left' else 1`
`random_value = direction_flag ^ shift_amt`
`random_hex = hex(random_value)[2:].upper().zfill(2)`

Your encryption output will now clearly encode rotation direction and shift amount numerically without any ambiguity.

‚úÖ Decryption fix (matching the above):
Now, in your decrypt script, adjust the logic clearly and numerically, as follows:

`python [Copy/Edit]`
`# Provided encrypted inputs`
`encrypted_hex_msg = "1C06111D4550191F1E17"`
`hex_key = "536563726574736573"`
`random_hex = "02"  # For example purposes: this would come from encryption above.`

`# Extract rotation direction and shift amount`
`random_value = int(random_hex, 16)`
`direction = 'left' if (random_value & 1) == 0 else 'right'`
`shift_amt = random_value`

`# XOR encrypted hex message with hex key to get rotated hex message`
`rotated_hex_msg = xor_hex(encrypted_hex_msg, hex_key)`

`# Reverse rotation correctly now`
`original_hex_msg = rot_hex(rotated_hex_msg, shift_amt, direction)`

`# Convert back to plaintext`
`decrypted_message = hex_to_txt(original_hex_msg)`

Now the XOR operation produces a guaranteed numerical value without multi-byte issues.

üåü Quick demonstration of why this will work:
Direction encoded clearly (left = `0`, right = `1`).

`XOR`-ing numerical shift amount with direction produces clear single-byte values.

During decryption, easily retrieve numerical shift and direction by simple bitwise checks.

No longer will multi-byte hex strings corrupt the integer shift amount.

üìù In short, fren:
Your original script mistakenly `XOR`‚Äôd multi-byte plaintext ("`left`") with single-digit integer values as characters.

This produced a corrupt, larger hex value when `XOR`‚Äôd and misinterpreted as a much larger shift amount.

The proper fix: `XOR` direction numerically (`0`/`1`) with shift amount integer directly.

‚ö° Next steps for you:
Make the small recommended numerical fix above in both encryption and decryption scripts.

Retry encryption and decryption using your plaintext `"Hello World"` again.

This fix will immediately restore correct, expected functionality.

Give this approach a try, fren‚Äîit'll clear everything up cleanly and neatly. Let me know if you need further help! üåü

I should comment, btw, when originally trying to solve the puzzle on my own it took over 8 hrs - a solid days work. chatGPT4.5 just did it from 14:00 to 16:08 - factoring in that I'm in the equation affecting time taken either way, a flat 2hrs to my 8hrs+ is pretty damn impressive!
Happy ending and win for the LLM I guess?
Maybe - would he ever have gotten there without the prompt hinting at the issue involving padding and if so after how many iterations? Personally, I haven't the patience or time to find out.

Considering all ChatGPT and Claude do for the most part is provide best answer based on info you give, i.e. debug output and IDE input. therefore, learning to read IDE colour codes and err/debug messages in e.g. vs code and to comprehend debugger output [which, for the most part, gives each err, line no. the cause and sometimes even best fix], you'll be taken a lot further than blind autopilot coding, instead actually progressing towards _understanding_!

As has been demonstrated here, although very effective at time saving, optimizing and debugging already working/mostly correct code [ChatGPT solved the problem in 1/4 the time it took me and halved the total line count whilst restructuring to remove stuff like unnecessary clutter etc.], LLMs are **_NOT_** able to reason. i.e. they currently do not have the capacity to solve an issue like need for padding in encryption when converting back n forth between plain and hexadecimal [*corollary: unless there's a specific bunch of discussion from stack exchange or w/e on that topic in the LLM's dataset.]
Furthermore, although with a little prompting we eventually got there, it relied very strongly on my having the prior knowledge of the eternal classic beginners hurdle in encryption - *p a d d I n g*, it could have continued for... hundreds? ...thousands? who knows how many **unsuccessful** iterations. i.e. this is not to say you cannot vibe code successfully, or even to say you shouldn't - more that when you encounter an issue not sufficiently covered in the LLM's dataset, due to lack of reasoning capability, you may get stuck for all eternity in a loop as the LLM tries to repeatedly refine code via minor syntax edits and logic alterations which never prove to bear fruit.

And that's just to get initial compiling/running code.

After this, in the real world, you would still have to test repeatedly, over time, to breaking point - run the code over and over again with every setup imaginable, under load and have it hold up even under extremes of use case. This require the knowledge and prior experience that comes with knowing what actually is required of final release code and the more subtle pitfalls possible etc. It's all very well getting working vibe coded results from an LLM, wrapping it up a lil' pretty and calling it an 'app', but, when 6 months later a windows update causes memory leaks that crash every single copy sold are you gonna be able to quickly put together an update that can be put into place overnight without screwing up any other software already on the systems running your app? think how many possible combinations of different OS, computer specs, other third party software and the rest of the horrendous gamut of variations on a theme you've gotta cope with are out there. And that's just scraping the surface.
Here we debugged a pair of 70 line educational puzzles - and it took 2hrs plus stress and still is not sound code you could release in the real world - in a work place that's effectively gonna be an entire day or night [meetings, scrums, lunch, etc.] Now imagine trying to do that for an 80+ module, 10k lines of code software release that has to be _perfect_.
Suddenly you realise maybe you shouldn't swear and threaten to throw your mouse out the window next time your computer opens a window a little bit slower than is ideal.
Are you _still_ sure you can cope doing that for a living, as part of a team, yours and other peoples incomes and jobs depending on such a situation, company reputations riding on such things, risk of getting sued if you cause damage or lost income or lost time to those using the software or even, perish the thought, injury or loss of life should circumstances arise?
Personally, I very much doubt that "'Vibe Coding' is going to take jobs away!!!' - more like AI assisted coding is going to greatly improve the lives of existing programmers, result in better code being written, much faster and hence generally improve the landscape of coding as it exists. It will be a long, long time before it results in a flood of people being paid minimum wage to copypasta and hit enter.

### Beware those who think they can get away with vibe coding their way through a _real_ job.

## Afterword:
Should you only intend to use the coding output for common, everyday tasks such as would have many, many examples of problems encountered and solutions proffered in the dataset of the LLM, e.g. setting up a data pipeline, converting datasets between different database formats etc., things that might be part of a more domestic and basic use case as part of throwing together something to solve a problem, then yes, chances are vibe coding will never be a problem and you could easily get away with scripting simpler programs to automate stuff and make life more pleasant without too much trouble trouble.
Otoh, if you actually want to be able to cope when the power's out, your LLM is offline and all you got is your laptop and you, or maybe you actually like coding and want to enjoy the fun of problem solving and tackling logic puzzles etc.; Welp, then vibe coding is effectively just cheating yourself out of the rewards. What's your use case and what do you want out of it - do you need complete control?

### Food for thought.


## Interesting points of note:
- At one point the LLM actually stuck with my `decrypt.py` as was, and edited the `encrypt.py` to match - it strikes me that 99% of humans would instinctively build 'upward' - i.e. start with the encrypt and fix the decrypt to match. I smell the fascinating evidence of something that solves via whatever route is overall the _best fit_ solution as opposed to employing reasoning to result in _most logical_ solution. Thoughts?
- I actually had to rotate through, variously, ChatGPT4.5, ChatGPTo1, ChatGPTo1-mini, ChatGPTo3-mini-High _and_ ChatGPT4o to get there.
- Personally I'm not loving this emoji business he's evolved - I don't even know if he's using 'em right, they look garish and messy on the page and make me feel uncomfortable. Will people be submitting job applications and CVs with emojis next? Oh noes - I'm‚Ä¶ o l d.  D:
[interestingly, after the progression into increasing emoji usage, my ChatGPT has begun using bad 'dad jokes' - like a very misunderstood sense of humour... would whoever is responsible please cut it out? Thank you.]


## Some advice for those who do want to try Vibe Coding as shown at the beginning of the article, and are curious:

### Don't rush, do read.
- Read _everything_ the LLM says in its instructions - to the end, each time, everytime.
- Do _not_ just copypasta in code, then copypasta out errs asap without paying attention:
LLMs have a habit of offering choices, switching back n forth between 'replace' vs. 'add' code snippets, inserting placeholders after not doing so 5 times previously - and if you don't pay attention, the error you end u asking it to fix is replaced not added code or a missing code due to placeholder resulting in a total mess...

### Give what you're working from.
- The thing can't read minds or anything in your computer - give it a break and attach your current codebase every-so-often so it knows where you're at and where you're coming from.
- This is at your discretion, if you just pasted a full code artifact and ran it then t knows what you got via assumption. if it's been 5 iterations there's plenty of room for both you and it to screw up/part ways so give a hint.

### Bear in mind, LLMs get full.
- At the end of the day when his lil' brain is getting all full up and he starts going a bit nutty, a full refresh can really help things - completely blanking the conversation, re-uploading the codebase and starting with a fully explained query as if you just sat down to solve a problem can be good. beware doing this with large projects
- I formerly hit the point of feeding Claude 3.5 Sonnet 4x batches of 20 code modules plus another 12-15 supporting documents then trying for a fresh start with a long prompt explain/asking. unsurprisingly I was hitting the token limit within a question or two and having to repeat the process.
Try only giving key code snippets, summary info etc. if you're struggling to provide summary overviews, good prompt questions and choosing the right code snippets etc. - guess who _is_ great at that? LLMs! just ask - they'll tell ya what they require and tell you what to say. prompt for prompts.

### You may need prior or specialised knowledge.
- If you know things that may trip up beginners, classic learner errors, gotchas, issues that arise commonly etc. or even obscure twists that no-one knows but  you've already figured out, warn the LLM early - the sooner you tell him the sooner he can account for these things and hence write more elegant, concise code whilst avoiding dead ends, pitfalls and iteration loops.
- Don't feel like you can sit back and just copypasta/hit run. it's a two way street of coaxing the LLM like a child prodigy through something for the first time whilst you learn from its clever new solutions and neat lil' elegant/tidy/compact ways.
you benefit way more if you work with an LLM, not just using it as a slave.

### Don't trust it to fly the plane.
- It's cruise control not autopilot.
- Again on the topic of not just copypasta-ing and then going for a smoke whilst it does the leg work: actually watch the LLM output, see it slowly iterate through the bogus 'reasoning' comments and overwriting back n forth across the code - it's where you see what's changing, why it's changing and eventually learn to spot what it got wrong.
Yes after some time, you too will begin to solve the issues the LLM couldn't, you'll be the one handling the tricky problems and fun logic puzzles whilst the LLM does the part of filling out the boring paperwork. See - co-pilot not such a dumb name after all, eh?

### Know when to switch model or LLM.
- Some LLMs and different models within the same LLM group will just have a better dataset/training setup for a given task than others. If you're starting to hit a wall, don't blindly keep iterating until you're 100 layers deep in the mire - try a different model or whole new LLM and see if you get better results.

### Sometimes it's more effective to make 'em redo their homework.
- it may prove more successful to repeat an existing prompt/solution combo request than carrying forward with the resiultant error deeper into the iterations.
- see it as retracing your steps and asking a different person for directions when lost vs. stumbling deeper into the confused jumble of city and becoming more lost.


For those who are interested, the final ChatGPTo1 output from the 'reasoning' feedback:

```Reasoning
So, the issue is that the expected decrypted message should be "Hell World," but decrypt.py outputs "ell World" with the first character missing. The problem is that the hexadecimal value for the first byte in the encrypted message, after XORing, is different from what it's supposed to be. It seems the XOR is too short when reversed between encryption and decryption, which causes this mismatch. Essentially, the first character gets lost when it's decrypted because of the insufficient key length.

In the encryption code...

...When manually checking the rotation calculations on the hexadecimal values, I see it leads to a mismatch: expected original message is "Hell World", but decrypt.py returns an incorrect result after rotation. The issue likely stems from a slight inconsistency in bit manipulations during rotation, especially with how the first byte is handled.

It looks like the issue may stem from how the encryption and decryption scripts handle the key during the XOR operation. In encryption, the key isn't repeated to match the message's length, so the key is applied as a shorter integer, creating a misalignment. This could cause the resulting XOR to only affect part of the message, potentially leading to discrepancies like the flipped bit we saw in the first byte.```


### yup, so there ya have it - after two hrs and approx. 20 iterations of back n forth trial and error for ChatGPT to solve a problem I admit took me a long day. I think it has its place. just not the whole place.
