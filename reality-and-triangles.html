<p>Nope, i’m not starting a highschool essay.</p>
<p>Honest - he really does.</p>
<p>He was a guy with an absolute brilliant mind who made significant
contributions to set theory, number theory, and topology, but he’s most
famous for his work in fractal geometry — those wild, self-repeating
shapes that look cool and bend your brain a little.</p>
<p>The Sierpiński Triangle, also called the Sierpiński Gasket, is his
claim to fame.</p>
<p>It’s a fractal that starts with a single equilateral triangle, and
then you keep removing smaller triangles from it in a specific pattern
forever (or until you get bored, I suppose). He first cooked up this
idea around 1915, and it’s a classic example of a self-similar structure
(meaning it looks the same no matter how much you zoom in.) Pretty
trippy, right?</p>
<p><em>(image)</em></p>
<p>Sierpiński wasn’t just a one-trick pony, though. He studied math at
the University of Warsaw, got his doctorate in 1908, and went on to
teach and research across Europe, even during some rough times like
World War I. He was a big deal in the Polish math scene and helped build
up the country’s academic community. Despite living through wars and
political upheaval, he kept churning out ideas — over 700 papers and 50
books, to be exact. The dude was unstoppable.</p>
<p>He passed away on October 21, 1969, in Warsaw, but his legacy lives
on every time someone doodles a Sierpiński Triangle or stares at a
fractal screensaver.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Let’s follow along in the guy’s footsteps and have some fun — after
all, he was a math rockstar who gave us a shape that’s equal parts
simple and mind-boggling - it’s gotta be fun, right?</p>
<p>let’s get you started by drawing a Sierpiński Triangle! It’s super
fun and not <em>too</em> tricky once you get the hang of it - Here’s a
simple step-by-step guide to sketch one by hand;</p>
<h2 id="how-to-draw-a-sierpiński-triangle">How to Draw a Sierpiński
Triangle:</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Start with a Big Triangle:</em> Grab a piece of paper and draw a
large equilateral triangle. Doesn’t have to be perfect — just make the
sides roughly equal. This is your base shape, or “Level 0.”</li>
<li><em>Find the Midpoints:</em> On each side of the triangle, mark the
halfway point. You can eyeball it or use a ruler if you’re feeling
precise.</li>
<li><em>Connect the Dots:</em> Draw lines connecting these midpoints to
form a smaller upside-down triangle in the center. You’ll see that this
splits the big triangle into three smaller triangles around the edges,
with the middle one being “cut out” (just imagine it’s gone for
now).</li>
<li><em>Repeat in the Smaller Triangles:</em> Take each of the three
remaining triangles (the ones that aren’t “cut out”) and do the same
thing—find the midpoints of their sides, connect them, and “remove” the
middle triangle. Now you’ve got even smaller triangles.</li>
<li><em>Keep Going (Optional):</em> You can repeat this process as many
times as you want. Each time, you’ll get more tiny triangles, and the
pattern starts looking more fractal-like. Three or four rounds usually
give you a nice Sierpiński vibe without needing a magnifying glass!
<em><em>Quick Tips</em></em></li>
<li><em>Use a pencil first so you can erase if needed.</em></li>
<li><em>If you color it, shade the “removed” triangles (or leave them
blank) to see the pattern pop.</em></li>
<li><em>Don’t stress about perfection—fractals are about the vibe, not
exactness.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that wasn’t too bad. Now, let’s do this via mathematical logic;
In logic, a Sierpiński triangle can be drawn by coloring the first 16
conjunctions of lexicographically ordered arguments on a grid where the
columns are interpreted as binary numbers i.e. giving us <em>1, 3, 5,
15, 17, 51…</em> (<em>this is sequence A001317 in the OEIS for any other
OEIS fans - yes i’m a touch on the spectrum</em>) - although, the actual
fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of
iterations.</p>
<p>Specifically, this Logic can be stated as, more formally, describing
it in terms of functions on closed sets of points: “let dA denote the
dilation by a factor of ⁠1/2⁠ about a point A, then the Sierpiński
triangle with corners A, B, and C is the fixed set of the transformation
dA ∪ dB ∪ dC⁠.” This is an ‘attractive fixed’ set, so that when the
operation is applied to any other set repeatedly, the images converge on
the Sierpiński triangle. (in fact,although this <em>is</em> what is
happening with the triangle above, any other set would suffice too.)</p>
<p>Employing number; For integer number of dimensions d, when doubling a
side of an object, 2^d copies of it are created, i.e. 2 copies for
1-dimensional object, 4 copies for 2-dimensional object and 8 copies for
3-dimensional object, 16 copies for a 4-dimensional object and so-on.
For the Sierpiński triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of
itself. This brings us to be able to say the Sierpiński triangle has
<em>‘Hausdorff dimension’</em> log3/log2 ≈ 1.585, which follows from
solving 2^d = 3 for d. why do i mention this? we’ll come back to this
later…</p>
<p>The area of a Sierpiński triangle is zero (in Lebesgue measure). This
means The area remaining after each iteration is 3/4 of the area from
the previous iteration, and an infinite number of iterations results in
an area approaching zero. (also relevant later)</p>
<p>This technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself,
removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended
to other shapes, for instance, subdividing a square removing the middle
and recursing leads to the ‘Sierpiński carpet’. In three dimensions, a
similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge.</p>
<h2 id="could-the-fabric-of-reality-be-a-fractal">Could the fabric of
reality be a fractal?</h2>
<p>What if the universe isn’t smooth and continuous, but instead
resembles a Menger sponge — a 3D fractal full of endlessly nested
cavities and intricate self-similarity?</p>
<p>One speculative hypothesis proposes that our universe’s structure
might resemble a Menger sponge - first described by Karl Menger in 1926,
a 3D fractal with endless cavities and intricate self-similarity; it
also explores what that means for the idea that we live in a simulation.
This idea blends cosmology, mathematics, quantum gravity, and simulation
theory into one speculative but intriguing model of reality.</p>
<h2 id="the-historical-roots-of-the-fractal-universe">The Historical
Roots of the Fractal Universe</h2>
<h3 id="early-thinkers">Early Thinkers:</h3>
<p>Charlier (1908), Fournier d’Albe, and Lambert imagined hierarchical,
“worlds within worlds” universes to explain cosmic observations like
Olbers’ paradox. These ideas predated formal fractal math but hinted at
scale invariance.</p>
<h3 id="the-fractal-revolution">The Fractal Revolution:</h3>
<p>Benoît Mandelbrot’s Fractal Geometry of Nature (1982) introduced
fractals as a model for natural structures. Pietronero (1987) observed
galaxy clustering patterns that fit a fractal dimension of ~2,
suggesting large-scale self-similarity.</p>
<h3 id="the-menger-sponge-re-enters-the-chat">The Menger Sponge
Re-enters the Chat:</h3>
<p>The sponge (Karl Menger, 1926) provided a vivid metaphor: infinitely
porous, zero volume, and infinite surface area (there’s our infinite
surface area returning from earlier). Later thinkers like Sylos Labini
and even Zel’dovich explored sponge-like or foam-like cosmic
structures.</p>

Implications of a Menger Sponge Reality</h2>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hausdorff dimension (remember from even earlier?) ≈ 2.7268 (between
2D and 3D)</li>
<li>Infinite surface area but zero volume</li>
<li>Self-similarity at all scales</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physics-consequences">Physics Consequences:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reality would be mostly holes—evocative of atomic-scale emptiness
and cosmic voids.</li>
<li>El Naschie proposed a fractal dimension explains why only ~4.5% of
the universe’s energy is visible (the rest is “missing” as dark
matter/energy).</li>
<li>A space with fractional dimension might radically alter physical
laws like gravity or field interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fractal-structures-in-theoretical-physics">Fractal Structures in
Theoretical Physics</h2>
<h3 id="cosmology">Cosmology:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generally, galaxy distribution in the universe appears fractal up to
~100–300 Mpc., beyond that, the universe seems statistically
homogeneous, but still the cosmic web (voids + filaments) is reminiscent
of fractal or sponge-like architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="at-a-quantum-scale">At A Quantum Scale:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quantum gravity theories (like Causal Dynamical Triangulations, Loop
Quantum Gravity - you know, the easy stuff…) suggest that spacetime
becomes fractal at Planck-scale - effective dimensionality reduces from
4 to ~2 as we zoom in, this is called “dimensional reduction.” Nottale’s
Scale Relativity and El Naschie’s E-infinity both treat space-time and
particle paths as inherently fractal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fractals-and-higher-dimensions">Fractals and Higher
Dimensions</h2>
<p>Karl Svozil suggests our universe could be a fractal subset embedded
in a higher-dimensional space—a Menger sponge “floating” in an unseen
super-verse - this bridges to string theory or brane-world scenarios but
with fractional rather than integer dimensions. In this view, the world
appears 3D, but reality may be a lower-dimensional “shadow” or
projection—an eerie geometric parallel to Plato’s cave.</p>
<h2 id="fractal-reality-simulation-theory">Fractal Reality &amp;
Simulation Theory</h2>
<h3 id="does-it-support-simulation-theory">Does It Support Simulation
Theory?</h3>
<p>Fractals can be generated by simple rules—potentially evidence of an
underlying “program” or intelligent design. Some see fractal structure
as a sign of algorithmic compression in a simulated world.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-challenge-simulation-theory">Does It Challenge
Simulation Theory?</h3>
<p>True fractals have infinite depth. Simulations with finite computing
power couldn’t represent this literally. If our reality does have
infinite nested detail (no “resolution limit”), that may argue against a
digital simulation—unless it uses something more exotic like continuous
math or analog computing.</p>
<h3 id="nested-simulations-as-a-fractal-stack">Nested Simulations as a
Fractal Stack:</h3>
<p>Simulations within simulations could form a “fractal tower” of
realities. Philosophically, this invites reflection on infinite regress
and whether a “base reality” is even meaningful.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-and-theoretical-hurdles">Experimental and
Theoretical Hurdles</h2>
<p>No conclusive experimental evidence supports a fully fractal
reality—so far. Cosmological surveys show some fractal behavior, but
also large-scale homogenization. Theoretical work in mathematical
physics (e.g., field theory on fractals) suggests that if space were
fractal, things like wave propagation or gravity might behave oddly—but
no anomalies have yet been observed.</p>
<h3 id="escaping-the-simulation">Escaping The Simulation</h3>
<p>What does fractal reality mean for a possible ‘Escape Hatch’ from
simulation? Could fractal structure offer an escape route from a
simulated universe? …Maybe!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Infinite detail might stress the simulation engine, leaving
detectable “rendering” artifacts—like computational noise or
inconsistency at deep zooms. Anomalies in physics at fine scales (e.g.,
gravity behaving oddly at ~10⁻²⁰ m) could hint at fractal structure or
simulation limits. Nested fractal layers might be like “simulation
levels.” Zooming in or out could correspond to traversing realities—but
we’d need a way to manipulate this scaling to “break out.”</p></li>
<li><p>Fractional dimensionality could be leveraged (in a sci-fi sense)
to “hack” the simulation—if our control over local dimensions becomes
possible via exotic tech or quantum tuning. Fractal consciousness
theories speculate that awareness itself might mirror reality’s
self-similar structure—potentially offering intuitive pathways to
perceive or transcend simulation boundaries.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>The Menger sponge metaphor unites speculative cosmology, quantum
gravity, fractal mathematics, and deep philosophical questions. Whether
it’s a literal description of the universe or a poetic approximation, it
prompts us to think of space not as an empty backdrop, but as an
intricate, living structure.</p>
<p>If the universe is a Menger sponge… then perhaps: - Matter is a
fragile thread, - Void is the default, - Reality is recursive, - And
“breaking out” is not about moving through space, but between levels of
structure or understanding.</p>
<p>I must admit, when i read Haussdorf dimension ≈ 2.7268, not 2 or 3 or
i kinda drifted off down an ‘oh - well we’re in a 3D space + 1D time =
4D universe, right? guess this whole theory is wrong’ tack.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems likely it’ll take more then even some hefty
quantum computing power before we’re gonna know…</p>
