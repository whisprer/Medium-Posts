A new way to look at our universe:

# A Fractal Universe By Math and Physics

## Come on a journey through math, physics and other dimensions...

in my preevious article i discussed and eventually kinda abandoned the concept that our universe is a 4D fractal 'Menger spone' projected from a 5D universe.

then a while later i was, as is my wont, browing medium when i came across this piece by Mathphye: It’s Time to talk about Time

https://medium.com/@mathphye/its-time-to-talk-about-time-ac4456aa4b22

not directly related as such until i read the last lil' near throw-away comment:

"Time is a “fake” dimension due to the holographic principle. It is a projective dimension, so it is not exactly 1D, 2D, 3D or 4D…"

Something clicked in my head...

not 3D? not 2D? like 2.7something D? ...whoa @.@

So the not quite workable 4D universe suddenly becomes a workable 3.9ishD universe? the MEnger sponge idea could be workable? hmmm... interesting - guess it might be worth doing the math then.

so lets  start by reiterating the math for the time theory we're using from Mathphye's article:

we're gonna cover

- *The Dimensionality of Time* – Using imaginary numbers and Minkowski spacetime.
- *The Non-Absoluteness of Time* – Using Lorentz transformations and relativity.
- *Time Reversibility and Entropy* – Using statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.
- *Time as an Emergent Phenomenon* – Using probability and stochastic processes.
- *Quantum Effects and Time* – Exploring quantum entanglement and retrocausality.

1. Dimensionality of Time: Complex Numbers & Spacetime
The article suggests that time may not be strictly one-dimensional, and that imaginary numbers (complex analysis) play a role in its formulation.

Minkowski Spacetime & Imaginary Time
In special relativity, spacetime is modeled using the Minkowski metric, which in its simplest (flat spacetime) form is:



which is just the Pythagorean theorem in four dimensions, showing that time behaves like a space dimension under this transformation.

This suggests:

Time is mathematically similar to spatial dimensions when rotated into imaginary space.
It could be bidimensional (real and imaginary components).
Singularities (such as black holes) may require analytic continuation using complex time.

2. Time is Not Absolute: Lorentz Transformations
The article argues that time is relative, which is a direct result of special relativity.

The Lorentz transformation for time is:



This means:

Faster motion = slower time (time dilation).
There is no absolute “now” since different observers measure different time coordinates.
Time appears curved in gravitational fields due to general relativity.
A famous consequence is the twin paradox, where one twin travels near light speed and ages more slowly than the other.

3. Time Reversibility and Entropy: Second Law of Thermodynamics
One of the article’s key ideas is that the arrow of time is an emergent property of entropy.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states:



This increase in entropy is why time appears to flow forward—it’s not fundamental to physics but a statistical tendency.

Statistical Mechanics View: Boltzmann’s Entropy Formula
Ludwig Boltzmann derived the relationship:



This tells us:

The universe started in a low-entropy state (Big Bang).
Over time, systems tend to spread into higher-probability states (heat death).
Reversing time would require an extremely improbable fluctuation.
Why Can’t We Time Travel Backwards?
For a system with N bits of information, the probability of returning to a previous exact state is:

Time reversal isn’t impossible, just astronomically unlikely.
The reason we experience a forward-moving time is purely statistical.

4. Time as an Emergent Phenomenon: Law of Large Numbers
The article describes time as a random process, governed by stochastic evolution.

The Law of Large Numbers states:



This means that for a system with many possible microstates, its evolution smoothly trends toward the most probable states.

Time as a Markov Process
One way to model time probabilistically is using a Markov chain, where state transitions follow:



This means:

The future state depends only on the present, not the entire past.
There is no inherent "direction," but entropy increases statistically.
Going back in time would require reversing all transitions, which is nearly impossible.
Thus, time emerges as a statistical trend, not as a fundamental property of reality.

5. Quantum Effects and Time: Entanglement & Retrocausality
The article hints at quantum mechanics’ weird relationship with time, especially:

Quantum entanglement – Instantaneous correlation between distant particles.
Delayed-choice quantum eraser – Future measurements can affect the "past."
Quantum Eraser Experiment
In this experiment, an entangled particle's behavior depends on a measurement that happens later, suggesting retrocausality (future influencing past).

Wavefunction and Imaginary Time
The Schrödinger equation governing quantum mechanics is:



which resembles a heat equation, reinforcing the connection between time, entropy, and diffusion.

Final Summary
The article presents time as an emergent, statistical illusion, based on:

Minkowski Spacetime – Time behaves as a geometric dimension with imaginary components.
Relativity – Time is relative to velocity and gravity (no absolute "now").
Thermodynamics – Time’s arrow emerges from entropy increasing.
Probability Theory – Time is stochastic, not fixed.
Quantum Mechanics – Time may not be fundamental, but a projection of a higher-dimensional process.
This all aligns with cutting-edge theories like:

The Holographic Principle (time as a projection of higher dimensions).
Emergent Spacetime (space-time itself is a statistical approximation).

 
So, if this is all true, the passage of time is a perception, not a fundamental feature of the universe. Instead of "flowing," time may simply be the way we interpret entropy and quantum state changes.

## leading us to space:



This image features a 3D-printed mathematical sculpture created by mathematician Henry Segerman, a researcher in geometry and topology, specializing in mathematical visualizations and projections. The image demonstrates an important concept in higher-dimensional geometry and shadows of curved spaces.

What the Image Represents:

The Object:
The physical structure in the hand is a 3D-printed spherical object with a curved grid-like design.
This object is shaped in such a way that it interacts with a light source to cast a specific shadow.
The design is inspired by mathematical visualizations of how higher-dimensional objects project onto lower dimensions.

The Shadow Projection:
The shadow cast on the flat surface resembles a uniform, straight-lined 2D grid.
The original 3D object is curved, but its projection onto the 2D plane appears as a perfect grid.
This is an example of how curved spaces can be represented in lower dimensions as seemingly “flat” spaces.

The Underlying Concept – Higher-Dimensional Projections:
Just as a 3D object can cast a 2D shadow, a 4D object could cast a 3D shadow.
In this analogy, the 3D object (curved sculpture) represents a higher-dimensional shape, while its shadow on the plane represents how lower-dimensional beings might perceive it.
The claim in the caption—though slightly exaggerated—suggests that what we perceive as flat (our 3D space) could be a projection of a higher-dimensional (4D curved) space-time.
Mathematical and Physical Relevance
This idea is deeply connected to differential geometry, topology, and general relativity.

Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity tells us that spacetime is curved by mass and energy.
However, to our everyday perception, we experience space as "flat"—just like the shadow of the curved 3D object appears flat on the 2D plane.
If we were 2D beings living in the shadow, we wouldn’t immediately perceive the curvature of the higher-dimensional object casting it.
Key Takeaways

Dimensional Projection: A higher-dimensional curved space (3D object) can cast a seemingly "flat" grid in a lower dimension (2D plane).

Analogy to 4D Spacetime: Our 3D world might itself be a projection or "shadow" of a curved four-dimensional spacetime.
Geometric Insight: This concept is frequently used in topology and physics to explain how we perceive dimensions lower than reality.

Mathematical Beauty: Henry Segerman often creates physical models to explain complex mathematical ideas in a visually intuitive way.

Conclusion
This sculpture and its shadow are a brilliant visual metaphor for how higher-dimensional objects project into lower dimensions, a key concept in mathematics and physics. While we live in what seems like a flat 3D world, it may be a projection of a larger, curved four-dimensional spacetime—just like the shadow is a 2D projection of a curved 3D object.


let's get deep into the math and physics behind this concept of higher-dimensional projections and curved spaces! We'll break it down into the mathematical structure, geometric interpretations, and physical analogies.

1. Foundations: Projections from Higher Dimensions
The core mathematical idea here is projection—how objects from a higher-dimensional space appear when "flattened" into a lower-dimensional one.

General Projection Rule
If an object exists in N dimensions, its projection into an (N-1) dimensional space loses some information but retains certain recognizable features.

A 3D object casts a 2D shadow.
A 4D object (if we could perceive one) would cast a 3D shadow.
A curved 3D object (like the one in the picture) can be designed so that its 2D projection looks perfectly flat and structured.
This principle allows us to visualize things that exist in higher-dimensional spaces using their lower-dimensional projections.

2. Understanding the Geometry in the Image
The Object: A Hyperbolic Grid or Stereographic Projection
The sculpture is not just any random 3D shape. It is designed to use a well-known mathematical technique called stereographic projection.

The grid pattern on the sphere is likely derived from hyperbolic geometry or a transformation of a uniform grid in a curved space.
When light shines through the 3D shape, it projects the curvature onto a flat surface, causing the shadow to look like a perfectly uniform Euclidean grid.
Mathematically, this works because:

The curvature in one space (the 3D sculpture) transforms in such a way that, when mapped to a 2D plane, it appears "flattened."
This is the same way spherical and hyperbolic geometries can be mapped onto Euclidean ones via projection.
Let’s define this rigorously:

3. The Mathematics of Stereographic Projection
The stereographic projection is a way to map points on a sphere to a flat plane. This is often used in cartography, but it has applications in visualizing higher dimensions.

Definition of Stereographic Projection
Given a unit sphere in 3D defined by:



the stereographic projection from the north pole onto the xy-plane is given by:



This transformation preserves angles but distorts lengths—causing a curved space (sphere) to appear flat when projected.

💡 Key idea: The sculpture in the image is designed such that when it is illuminated, the light's rays act like a stereographic projection, transforming the curved 3D grid into a straight 2D shadow.

4. Hyperbolic and Spherical Geometry in the Sculpture
Now, let’s talk about why the curved shape in the sculpture produces a seemingly flat projection.

Hyperbolic vs. Euclidean vs. Spherical Spaces
Euclidean Space (Flat Space)
The normal 2D and 3D spaces we deal with in everyday life.
Satisfies Euclid's Parallel Postulate: Given a line and a point not on the line, only one parallel line exists.
Spherical Geometry (Positively Curved Space)
The geometry of the surface of a sphere.
No parallel lines exist (all great circles eventually intersect).
Angles in a triangle sum to more than 180°.
Hyperbolic Geometry (Negatively Curved Space)
A space where infinitely many parallel lines can pass through a given point.
Triangles have angles summing to less than 180°.
Used in General Relativity to describe curved spacetime.
Mathematical Link to the Image:

The sculpture is likely a hyperbolic structure.
When illuminated, the way light travels through its grid mimics the effects of curved space projecting into a lower dimension.
This aligns with the general concept that our perceived 3D space might be a projection of a higher-dimensional curved 4D space.

5. Connection to General Relativity: Curved 4D Spacetime
Now let’s get really deep—how does this relate to Einstein's curved spacetime?

Einstein’s Key Idea
In General Relativity, mass and energy curve spacetime.
A seemingly flat 3D space could be a projection of a curved 4D manifold.
Mathematically, spacetime is represented as a 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold with a metric:



This describes the distances in 4D spacetime.

However, when mass is present, the metric curves into something like:



which is the Schwarzschild Metric describing curved space near a massive object.

Why is this important?

If spacetime is curved in 4D, then our perceived 3D world is a lower-dimensional "shadow" of that curvature.
This is similar to how the sculpture’s curved shape produces a projection that appears flat in 2D.

What's the big idea?
Just as the sculpture transforms a 3D curved grid into a flat 2D shadow, our entire 3D universe might be the shadow (projection) of a higher-dimensional 4D reality.

6. Conclusion: The Image as a Metaphor for Dimensional Reduction
The mathematical and physical concepts in this image illustrate a deep relationship between dimensions and projection:

- Stereographic Projection – Maps curved 3D objects into flat 2D images.
- Hyperbolic Geometry – The structure in the sculpture likely represents negative curvature.
- General Relativity – Space itself might be curved in four dimensions, meaning our perception of "flat" space is actually a lower-dimensional shadow of a higher reality.

Final Thought: If a curved 3D object can project as a "flat" 2D shadow, is it possible that our entire 3D universe is the projection of a 4D space? Let's See!


1. What is a 4D Menger Sponge and Why Use It?
The Menger Sponge is a fractal structure, meaning it exhibits self-similarity at all scales. It's a generalization of the Cantor Set and Sierpiński Carpet into three dimensions and beyond.

A 4D Menger Sponge would be:

A hierarchical structure with self-similar voids.
A projection of a higher-dimensional shape into 3D (like a 4D hypercube casting a 3D shadow).
A space where nested scales of reality exist—perfect for modeling how entropy, time, and space interact.
In this view, our universe might not be just a 4D Minkowski space, but a structured, fractal 4D spacetime with recursion across dimensions.

2. Unifying 4D Projection & Time: Minkowski Space vs. Fractal Time
Minkowski Metric in 4D
Ordinary flat spacetime (Special Relativity) follows the Minkowski metric:



However, if time is fractal (nested across scales), we must generalize this to higher-dimensional, self-repeating structures.

Adding a 4th Spatial Dimension
If the universe is actually a 4D Menger Sponge, we introduce an extra spatial coordinate 



This extra dimension is NOT time, but a hidden fractal dimension where spacetime "folds in on itself" at different scales.

Fractal (Menger) Time: A Self-Similar Arrow of Time
Instead of one-dimensional time, we propose fractal time, where events branch recursively. A good model for this is:



This means time doesn’t "flow" linearly but recursively branches like the structure of the sponge.

## Implications:
- Entropy increases in a fractal manner, not linearly.
- Time appears emergent—what we call the "present" is just a zoomed-in subset of the larger fractal structure.
- This could naturally explain quantum branching (Everett's Many-Worlds) in a physical way.

3. How Does Entropy Fit in?
In standard physics, the Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us entropy always increases:



But in a Menger Sponge universe, entropy increase follows a fractal pattern, where localized decreases are possible in exchange for increases at higher scales.



=



## This means:
- Entropy is fractal, not absolute.
- Time appears to "flow" because entropy prefers branching paths rather than simple forward motion.
- Entropy gradients might be the real reason we experience time, and those gradients are self-similar.

4. The Projection of the 4D Menger Universe into 3D Space
Now, let’s apply what we learned about stereographic projections and 4D space.

If our universe is a 4D Menger Sponge, then:

What we perceive as 3D space is just a lower-dimensional slice of a fractal 4D topology.
Time is NOT an extra dimension—it is an emergent, recursive property of the projection.
Gravity and spacetime curvature might arise from the "holes" in the sponge, where parts of the universe are recursively removed in different scales.
Using stereographic projection, a 4D structure casts 3D projections as:



## The distortion in these projections could explain:
- Why gravity warps spacetime (it’s just the projection of a higher fractal curvature).
- Why quantum mechanics allows for superposition (parts of reality are overlapping projections of the same 4D structure).

5. Quantum Effects and The Holographic Principle
The Holographic Principle states that the information of a 3D universe can be encoded on a 2D surface. This perfectly aligns with the Menger Sponge model!

A 4D Menger Sponge projected onto a 3D universe follows the same rules as a holographic system.
Quantum entanglement might simply be a manifestation of fractal recursion—when two particles are entangled, they share a structure across multiple levels of the sponge.
If we assume time exists as a projection of this fractal structure, then retrocausality (future affecting past) and time dilation are just symmetries of the projection process.

## Final Unified Model: The 4D Menger Universe
We now propose the Menger-Spacetime Theory:

- The universe is a 4D Menger Sponge—a fractal structure extending beyond our 3D perception.
- Time is an emergent property of fractal entropy, not a separate dimension.
- Gravity and spacetime curvature arise from the recursive voids in the sponge.
- Quantum mechanics is a consequence of overlapping self-similar projections of reality across scales.
- The "now" is a fractal subset of reality, meaning no absolute present exists.

6. What This Model Could Explain
- Why we can’t time-travel backwards: The fractal arrow of time is a branching process—paths cannot be perfectly reversed due to entropy.
- Why quantum mechanics is weird: The fractal structure allows multiple "projections" of reality to exist simultaneously, like a quantum superposition.
- Why gravity is weak compared to other forces: If it’s the effect of a 4D recursion, its influence might be diluted across many fractal levels.
- Why relativity and quantum mechanics don’t fit together: Relativity assumes smooth continuous space, while this model assumes a discrete fractal structure, naturally bridging the two.

# Mind-Blowing Takeaway
If our universe is a 4D Menger Sponge, then time, space, and reality itself are just fractals of a deeper structure. We aren’t moving through time—we’re simply experiencing different projections of a self-similar cosmic recursion.
